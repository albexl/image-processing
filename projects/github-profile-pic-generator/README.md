# github-profile-pic-generator

Let's generate a GitHub profile pic! This project aims to create images like the ones GitHub uses as profile pics by default.

## Requirements

Requirements to run this project are in the `requirements.txt` file. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to properly install all the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

To get your randomized profile pic (GitHub style), type `python main.py` in your terminal. Then check the resulting image in the `root` directory.
